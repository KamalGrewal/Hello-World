# Hello-World

<p>In Web Design, I want to make websites that are easy to use and nice to look at. My goal is to create sites where people can find what they need quickly without any confusion. I’m not from an IT background, but I’m eager to learn how to build websites that work well and look good. I want to help people and businesses by making their online presence clear, simple, and attractive. </p>
